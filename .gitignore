# We might want to keep the scripts if they are generic, but sometimes they hardcode paths. 
# The user's scripts seemed generic enough, but safe to ignore if they become user-specific.
# Actually, the user asked to push, so maybe we SHOULD keep the launch scripts if they are useful for others?
# I'll keep them UN-ignored unless requested otherwise, but definitely verify .env is ignored.
